# Go User CRUD API

This is a simple user CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Go (Golang). It provides a basic set of endpoints to manage users in a database. This project demonstrates how to structure a Go application with repositories, services, and controllers.

## Features

- User CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- API with clean architecture (Controller, Service, Repository)
- Simple database connection with SQLite
- Request validation

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up this project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fatihbahadir/go-user-crud.git
cd go-user-crud
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Before running the application, you need to install the required Go dependencies.

```bash
go mod tidy
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

### 3. Set Up the Database

The application uses SQLite as the database by default. Make sure you have SQLite installed on your system. If you're using a different database, you may need to modify the configuration file (`config/database.go`) to use your preferred database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL).

### 4. Run the Application

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
go run main.go
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:8888`.
